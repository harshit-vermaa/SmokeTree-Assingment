# SmokeTree-Assingment

I have completed the assignment according to the requirements given to me on Internshala.
I have created the backend where users can input their first name, last name, and address.
The names will be stored in a separate collection known as 'userModel,' and the address will be stored in a separate collection known as 'addressModel.'
I have also pushed the .env file so you can test and run the code.

This assignment was developed using MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js.
